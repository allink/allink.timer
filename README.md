PRISKA
======

Time Tracking Application for the project management software [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) written in HTML/CSS and jQuery.  
Connect your Basecamp Account with your personal API Token and start tracking time on projects.

Best Practice
-------------

allink stores this source on a share point and created a MenuExtra MacOS X App with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) which
loads the `index.html` file over the filesystem e.g. `file:///Volumes/sharepoint/priska/index.html`. Thanks Fluid we can use [Growl](http://growl.info/) as notification service over JavaScript too!

Theming
-------

Just replace the content of `theme.css` with the infile css source code of a Basecamp page of your account.
