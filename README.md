allink.timer
============

Time Tracking Application for the project management software [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) written in HTML/CSS and jQuery.  
Connect your Basecamp Account with your personal API Token and start tracking time on projects.

Best Practice
-------------

allink created a MenuExtra MacOS X App with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) which contains a clone of the `src` folder.
So the Fluid App points to `file:///Applications/allink.timer.app/src/index.html`.
Thanks Fluid we can use [Growl](http://growl.info/) as notification service over JavaScript too!

Theming
-------
Just replace the content of `theme.css` and `loader.gif` with the infile css source code of a Basecamp page of your account.
